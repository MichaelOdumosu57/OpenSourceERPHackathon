{
    'pickupAddr':  {
      "name": "Mickey and Minnie Mouse",
      "phone": "714-781-4565",
      "company_name": "The Walt Disney Company",
      "address_line1": "500 South Buena Vista Street",
      "city_locality": "Burbank",
      "state_province": "CA",
      "postal_code": "91521",
      "country_code": US //backend handles this
    },
    'deliveryAddr':  {
      "name": "Mickey and Minnie Mouse",
      "phone": "714-781-4565",
      "company_name": "The Walt Disney Company",
      "address_line1": "500 South Buena Vista Street",
      "city_locality": "Burbank",
      "state_province": "CA",
      "postal_code": "91521",
      "country_code": US //backend handles this
    },
    'length': a,     //units inches
    'width': a,
    'height':a,
    'unit': inch
    'weight':a,
    'carrier': backend grabs all //the backend will get that
}





1st page response for the second page
    just grab an order
    compare it to the walmart requirements
    hold in the backend the best choice for probably the first option



walmart requirements

backend will take care of conditionds

2nd page
were sending summary

{
    pickupAddr:
        {
            zip:
        },
    destAddr:
        {
            zip
        },
    weight:{
        unit:
        value:
    },
    package_type
}

shipping quotes
{
    carrier_name:
    business_days:
    price:
    choose:false,
    id:
}


so from the rates repsonse we need to id all the different quotes
and we choose that quote object from the rates response and continue to the 3rd page



3rd page
take that shipping and make an api requests






types of problems we can have
